[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/py2be.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/py2be)


## Introduction

**to-be** is a library providing facilities for determine whether the truthyness of strings. It implemented in several languages: **py2be** is the **Python** implementation.

## Terminology

The term "*truthy*" is an unhelpfully overloaded term in the programming world, insofar as it is used to refer to the notion of "truthyness" - whether something can be _deemed to be_ interpretable as truth - and also the true side of that interpretation. In this library, the former interpretation is used, leaving us with the following terms:

* "*truthy*" - whether something can be can be _deemed to be_ interpretable as having truth;
* "*falsey*" - whether an object can be _deemed to be_ interpretable as being false;
* "*truey*" - whether an object can be _deemed to be_ interpretable as being true;

For example, consider the following **Python** program:

```Python
from py2be import (
	string_is_falsey,
	string_is_truey,
	string_is_truthy,
)

s1 = "no"
s2 = "True"
s3 = "orange"

# "no" is validly truthy, and is falsey
assert string_is_falsey(s1)
assert !string_is_truey(s1)
assert string_is_truthy(s1)

# "True" is validly truthy, and is truey
assert !string_is_falsey(s2)
assert string_is_truey(s2)
assert string_is_truthy(s2)

# "orange" is not validly truthy, and is neither falsey nor truey
assert !string_is_falsey(s3)
assert !string_is_truey(s3)
assert !string_is_truthy(s3)
```
